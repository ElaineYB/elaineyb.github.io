## About me
I am returning to school to earn my degree in Cybersecurity.  This is not the path that I thought I would take, but I am excited for a new chapter.  I am a wife, mother to two adult children, and two dobermans.  I am a military veteran.  I look forward to learning new things and obtaining new skills that will be beneficial moving forward.

### My interests
I enjoy reading, traveling, learning new things, and spending time with family.  Although I love travel, I love being at home. I am also new to gardening and would like to turn by backyard into a food farm.


#### Websites I recommend
Websites that I recommend are Pinterest.com and Mindful.org.  I love Pinterest.com because you can find ideas pertaining to just about any subject.  Mindful.org offers some helpful tools for mental health.
